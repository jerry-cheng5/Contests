# Contests
 
This is a folder with all my solutions to past programming contest questions. They were taken from Waterloo's CCC, DMOJ, Hacker Rank, and LeetCode. These are all the finished products, after they were graded by the code testers in each contest's website.  These are mainly written in Python 3, and act as my way of learning the language.
